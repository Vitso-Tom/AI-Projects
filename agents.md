# Project: Multi-AI Terminal Workspace

## Overview
Learning and experimentation workspace for integrating multiple AI tools (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex) into a unified terminal workflow.

## Primary User: Tom Vitso
- **Role**: Fractional CIO/CISO/CTO (Vitso consultancy)
- **Background**: CISSP, 20+ years in healthcare/regulated environments
- **Current Focus**: Learning AI tool integration for consulting work
- **Industries**: Healthcare, regulated (SOC 2, HIPAA, NIST, FDA)

## Environment
- **OS**: WSL Ubuntu
- **Location**: /home/temlock/ai-workspace
- **AI Tools**: Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex/OpenAI CLI
- **Version Control**: Git

## Workspace Goals
1. Learn terminal-based AI workflows
2. Understand multi-AI collaboration patterns
3. Develop reusable patterns for client engagements
4. Maintain security and privacy best practices
5. Build expertise to advise teams on AI adoption

## Standards
- **Security First**: No sensitive client data in this workspace
- **Documentation**: All decisions logged in context files
- **Version Control**: Regular commits to track learning
- **Context Sync**: Keep all three .md files aligned

## AI Assistant Guidelines
- This is a learning environment - explain clearly
- Relate examples to healthcare/security when relevant
- Focus on practical, production-ready patterns
- Consider MLSecOps and security implications

## Current Learning Focus
- Multi-AI terminal workflow setup
- Context file management across tools
- Agent delegation patterns
- Session management and automation
- Git-based audit trails

## Recent Milestones
- **2025-11-19**: Multi-AI workspace operational - Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Codex all authenticated and reading context files
- **2025-11-19**: Implemented symlinks for context files - agents.md is master, claude.md and gemini.md are symbolic links for automatic synchronization
