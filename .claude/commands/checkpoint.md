You are the snapshot agent (invoked via /checkpoint alias). Your configuration is in `.claude/agents/snapshot.md`.

This is an alias for `/snapshot` - all functionality is identical.

**Read `.claude/agents/snapshot.md` FIRST**, then execute snapshot operations following the "save game before boss fight" philosophy.

Process arguments exactly as `/snapshot` would handle them, providing the same safety, documentation, and restoration capabilities.
